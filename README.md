# RenewableEnergy_InnovateCO

This was the project for the Data Challenge called InnovateCO held by Colorado BIC. 

### Project Description
Using predictive machine learning models, we determined the required quantity of solar panels per individual in Colorado to meet the rising demand for coal-generated electricity. Furthermore, we provided recommendations on how to achieve the objective of attaining 100% renewable energy in Colorado by the year 2040.
